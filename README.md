# Slean Note

Slean Note is an old note-taking app I created before [Amphi Notes](https://github.com/amphi2024/notes).  
Some mobile UI elements in Amphi Notes were influenced by Slean Note.

The name "Slean" comes from Simple + Clean.

With this app, you can:
- Edit plain text
- Insert images and view them in a pager
- Create themes to customize the app's UI colors
- Organize notes like a traditional file system
- Manually change the created and modified dates

Enjoy my spaghetti :)

## Behind the Scenes

I made this app when I first started learning how to code.  
While updating it, I had to serve in the military in Korea. After returning, I started working on [Amphi Notes](https://github.com/amphi2024/notes).

Back then, I even tried to monetize the app with in-app ads and purchases (this repository does not include all of that code).  
Since I didn't know how to manage shared code properly, I ended up copying and pasting code to maintain separate projects for One Store and Google Play.
